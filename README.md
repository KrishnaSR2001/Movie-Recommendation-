To obtain recommendations for our users, we will predict their ratings for movies they haven’t watched yet. Movies are then indexed and suggested to users based on these predicted ratings.
To do this, we will use past records of movies and user ratings to predict their future ratings. At this point, it’s worth mentioning that in the real world, we will likely encounter new users or movies without a history. Such situations are called cold start problems.
